# Tic_Tac_Toe with SQL API
This classic Tic_Tac_Toe game features a SQLite API connected with an SQLite database(SQLite installed required) to track players' history. 
When a player returns to the game and types in the identical name, the program will look it up in the "Players" table and cordially welcome that player back to the game.
There are two different player modes, player v.s. player and player v.s. computer.
